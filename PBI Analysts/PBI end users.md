Start with Dashboard in a Day
* Dashboard in a Day is a free online class delivered by our partners: [DIAD Events](https://events.microsoft.com/?timeperiod=next30Days&isSharedInLocalViewMode=true&country=United%20States&language=English&product=Power%20BI)

* Once the basics are understood, please review the data modeling resources.
Power BI is a data model driven BI tool -that means the design of the data drives behavior rather than scripts or code.  Creating a good data model is 80% of the work.

* After data modeling, review report optimization resources

* A understanding of Basic DAX (the calculation language of Power BI) will help add analtical value to the reports.
