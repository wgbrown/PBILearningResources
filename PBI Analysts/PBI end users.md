Start with Dashboard in a Day - This will give a good understanding of the trhee main topics

* Once the basics are understood, please review the data modeling resources.
Power BI is a data model driven BI tool -that means the design of the data drives behavior rather than scripts or code.  Creating a good data model is 80% of the work.
