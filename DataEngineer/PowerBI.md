Advanced tecniques for users who have mastered the basics

##Power BI navigation - Navigation has quite a bit of impact on use adoption.  

[Apps support customized navigation](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/designing-custom-navigation-for-power-bi-apps-is-now-available/)

[Button navigation - Actions](https://radacad.com/page-navigation-buttons-in-power-bi)

[Bookmarks - Storytelling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-bookmarks) and some [Use case examples](https://tessellationtech.io/toggling-views-with-bookmarks-in-power-bi/)

##Data security - restricing access to a subset of the data based on the user
[Basic Row Level Security -RLS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/admin/service-admin-rls) and [walk through](https://www.sqlshack.com/introduction-to-row-level-security-in-power-bi/)
Remember that users with RW access to the workspace (Admin, Contributer or Member) will NOT have RLS rules applid.  As editors, they could remove themselves from the role so security is not applied.  It is a best pratice to distribute content via APPs and not the workspaces.  [APPS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/consumer/end-user-apps)

For reuse of security rules across Power BI datasets, an approach called Table driven security can be utilized.  This is a more complex technique but makes managment and reuse of rules much easier.
