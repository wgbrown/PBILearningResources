Report optimizaton focus on data model efficently, DAX optimizations and report best pratices.  

[Import model optimization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/import-modeling-data-reduction)  The Power BI data models is the starting point for report performance optimization. 
A model that follows best pratices often needs no other work on the DAX and report pages.
