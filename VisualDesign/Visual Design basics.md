Creating high performing reports with rich calculations is a critical but good report design can improve user adoption and reduce confusion.  There is little worse than no one 
using your reports. Here are some practices and references to create great looking reports.

Good metrics take the raw data and describe it. 

Comparing data against a prior period shows direction.  

Variance from a target or goal shows how we are meeting expectations.  

How to communicate the information, or even to wonder what use a Pie chart is? Selecting the right visual is half art but also half science.
